Iâ€™m  Kireeti, a pre-final year B.Tech student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, with a strong interest in full stack web development.

Beyond full-stack development, I have a strong passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm actively exploring concepts like deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, gaining hands-on experience with frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. My goal is to apply these cutting-edge technologies to build intelligent and impactful applications, and I'm eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of AI.            </p>
